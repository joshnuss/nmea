# NMEA

NMEA (National Marine Electronics Association) 0183 is a standard for parsing sensor data for many marine electronics like echo sounders, sonars, anemometers, gyrocompasses, autopilots and GPS receivers.

Example GPS data looks like this:

```bash
cat /dev/ttyACM0
```

Every line starts with a dollar sign. The next 2 characters is the "talker", followed by 3 characters for the "type" of record. It is followed by a CSV and then a "*" followed by a checksum.

Tested with a [ublox series 6 GPS receiver](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/neo-6-series).

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `nmea` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:nmea, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
